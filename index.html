  <h1>First post</h1>
  <p>First posts are hard.</p>
  <p>It's true. The number of times I've sat at a computer, staring at the blinking cursor, willing myself, to just write <em>something</em> so I could be done with it and move on, are simply dizzying.</p>
  <p>This post itself has been too long in the making. I'm not proud to say that there have been times I simply gave up and walked away.</p>
  <p>But I digress, if a first post is simply about the fact of it <em>being</em> a first post, then I've failed. No one wants to descend into that self-referential mess.</p>
  <h2>So why this? Why now?</h2>
  <p>I am not 100% sure myself. If you want dear reader, you may imagine that I woke one night with a sudden thought, ideas rushing through my head. It is close to enough to the truth, with some embellishment.</p>
  <p>I decided to take this&mdash;whatever this is&mdash;one step at a time. Countless are the time that I've gotten mired down in the details, stuck on some issue. Be it the exact shade of red to use or the perfect Javascript framework.</p>
  <p>So I decided to pare it back, way back. Learn to walk before I can run. Take baby steps and build up to something, possibly something great.</p>
  <p>The first step, is this. Words on a page. A sketch on a blank canvas.</p>
  <p>This page is no more than some simple HTML wrapped around text, as close to pen and paper as you can get on the web. This site is and will continue to be, <a href="https://github.com/chinthakagodawita/redspecific.com" title="This site's codebase, on Github">on Github</a>, free for anyone to peruse.</p>
  <p>I have allowed myself a <em>couple</em> of luxuries. Firstly, three style rules that hopefully improve the reading experience slightly.</p>
  <p>The second, I am slightly ashamed in admitting to. I added my Google Analytics to this page. Call it vanity, call it whatever you want, I love stats. There's just something about seeing numbers on a analytics graphs that sends shivers down my spine.</p>
  <p>My plan moving forward is to let this evolve, add to it and grow it beyond these humble beginnings.</p>
  <p>Whatever this may be, it <em>is</em> a start.</p>
